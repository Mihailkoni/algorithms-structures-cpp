# A repository for storing all header files with structures and algorithms in C++
## These were assignments in the discipline "Fundamental algorithms and Data Structures" in the second year of university
### Data structures
- [`Circular Doubly Linked List`](Circular_Doubly_Linked_List.h): adding to the list, deleting from the list, searching for a node, list output, reverse list output, deleting the entire list, symmetric difference, deletion after each occurrence of a given one ([GeeksForGeeks: Introduction to Circular Doubly Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-circular-doubly-linked-list/));
- [`AVL-Tree`](AVL_Tree.h): adding, deleting from the right, balancing, searching, output, reverse traversal of the tree ([GeeksForGeeks: AVL Tree Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-avl-tree/));
- [`Hash-Table`](Hash_Table.h): cell status (0,1,2), open addressing, quadratic insertion point search, hash function middle of square, dynamic type ([GeeksForGeeks: Hash Table Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/hash-table-data-structure/));
- [`Graph`](Graph.h): undirected, weighted, internal representation of a Circular Doubly Linked List, breadth-first and depth-first traversal, algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree, Prim's algorithm ([Introduction to Graph Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-graphs-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)).
### Algorithms
- [`Pattern Searching`](Search_in_string.h): Rabin-Karp algorithm and Turbo Bowyer-Moore algorithm ([EXACT STRING MATCHING ALGORITHMS](https://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/index.html));
- [`Array search`](Array_Search.h): Sentinel linear search algorithm and Uniform Binary Search algorithm ([GeeksForGeeks: Sentinel Linear Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/searching-algorithms/), [GeeksForGeeks: Uniform Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/uniform-binary-search/));
- [`Array Sorting`](Array_Sort.h):  Improved bubble algorithm and Shell algorithm with Sedgwick distance ([w3schools: DSA Bubble Sort](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_bubblesort.php), [[GeeksForGeeks: Shell Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/shell-sort/)).
